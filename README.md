# TideRec
TideRec is a Python package for performing tidal reconstruction developed by [Shihui Zang](zangshastro.com). This package can perform both 5-shear-term and 2-shear-term tidal reconstruction according to [Zhu et al. 2021](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.01575). Here we provide some functions to analyze the result of tidal reconstruction.

__Note that some functions are still under development.__ If you find any bug or have any suggestion, please do not hesitate to email me. Next we will use fftw to accelerate the calculation and develop more analyze functions such as analysis with regard to wedges $\mu$, along with 2-D slice preview function.
